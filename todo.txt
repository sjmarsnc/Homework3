Still to do: 

* rounded corners on container
* get correct color on generate password button - done, used paint and eyedropper 
* reset array each time and make sure at least one type of character is chosen, or default to all. 
blank out password when generating a new one, also unselect the textarea 
* get "your secure password" to appear before password is generated 
* ruling lines - even with box   
* center buttons when they stack 
indicate by changing content of button when it has been copied?
